# RAPx targeted benchmark

This repository contains the 10 crates with the most public targets in the
2026-09-28 175-crate RAPx run. Their published source is pinned and each target
is annotated with `#[rapx::verify]`.

The **Targeted RAPx verify** workflow has only `workflow_dispatch`; run it from
the Actions page whenever a measurement is needed. The form has separate
timeouts for ordinary crates and `smallvec`; their defaults are 15 and 120
minutes respectively. Every run resolves and installs the newest non-yanked
`rapx` release from crates.io, then runs:

```text
cargo +nightly rapx verify --mode targeted --postfix-repeat auto
```

Ten crates run independently. The workflow summary and `targeted-summary`
artifact contain only the latest RAPx version, its release-time nightly, and
`SOUND`, `UNSOUND`, `UNKNOWN`, and `NOT_RUN` counts and percentages. The pass
rate is `SOUND / targets listed in targets.json`.

`NOT_RUN` means that RAPx emitted no verdict for that manifest target. Typical
causes are a disabled Cargo feature or platform `cfg`, a per-crate timeout, or
RAPx stopping or omitting a target before producing its result. It is not an
`UNSOUND` verdict. rustc may print an internal type behind a public type alias;
the result parser maps known aliases before deciding that a target did not run.
RAPx 0.7.50 also selects some unannotated `Drop` implementations in targeted
mode, so records not present in `targets.json` are excluded from the benchmark.

RAPx uses unstable rustc-private APIs, so a floating `nightly` can stop compiling
after a rustc change. The resolver pins the nightly available when the selected
RAPx release was published; the setup job installs RAPx and runs a CLI self-check
before starting the 10 verification jobs.

`targets.json` records the selected API paths, crate versions, original crate
archive checksums, and historical download ranks. Some API paths have more than
one source annotation behind mutually exclusive `cfg` branches; they still
count as one manifest target.

## Struct invariants

The vendored sources currently include 11 representation invariants. RAPx
0.7.55 accepts these annotations, and `--prepare-targets` resolves them to the
intended fields:

| Crate | Struct | Invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `heapless` | `c_string::CString` | `ValidCStr(inner.buffer.buffer, inner.len)` |
| `heapless` | `spsc::Iter`, `spsc::IterMut` | `index <= len` |
| `smallvec` | `DrainFilter` | `del <= idx`, `idx <= old_len` |
| `smallvec` | `IntoIter` | `current <= end` |
| `slotmap` | `SlotMap`, `HopSlotMap`, `SecondaryMap` | `num_elems < slots.len()` |
| `slotmap` | `DenseSlotMap` | `keys.len() == values.len()`, `keys.len() < slots.len()` |

These are facts guaranteed by each type's constructors and state transitions.
They are supplied to the already selected methods; they do not add entries to
`targets.json`. `DrainFilter` and its invariant are feature-gated in `smallvec`.
Pointer provenance, initialized storage prefixes, and relationships hidden
behind atomics or trait-associated storage are not annotated because RAPx's
current invariant syntax cannot express them reliably.

## Results

Every completed branch run is committed by `github-actions[bot]` under:

```text
results/<Asia-Shanghai date>/run-<GitHub run id>[-attempt-N]/
```

[`results/README.md`](results/README.md) is rebuilt as a newest-first index.
Each run directory contains `summary.md`, `summary.json`, `run.json`, and one
compact JSON result per crate under `crates/`.

The full logs remain attached to each workflow run instead of being committed
to Git history:

- `targeted-summary` contains `summary.md` and `summary.json` and is retained
  for 90 days.
- Each `result-<crate>-<version>` artifact contains that crate's `result.json`
  and full `rapx.log` and is retained for 30 days.

Open a completed workflow run and download these files from the **Artifacts**
section at the bottom of its Summary page. The compact table is also rendered
directly in the run's job summary.
